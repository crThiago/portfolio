            Achieving the three Rs of software development: Refactorability,
            Reusability, and Readability
          </h2>
          <p>
            Good code is easy to understand and maintain. It achieves the three
            Rs of Software Architecture: Refactorability, Reusability & Readability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Achieving the three Rs has always been important but has become even
            more so, in recent years. Products are often implemented in multiple
            ways for a variety of audiences, devices, and platforms. All this makes
            sharing and reusing components between projects, an absolute must.
          </p>
          <p>
            Code that is not easy to isolate, reuse, and understand will not be
            adopted by other projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can check your own code by publishing components to Bit. If you’ve
            built it right, you’ll find it very easy to publish components and reuse
            them in other projects.
